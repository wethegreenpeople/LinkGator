Don't be so aggresive with comments. Code should be self documenting with small, well named functions, and variables. Comments should only be left as doc style comments or for things that are outside the normal.
Code solutions should be as small as possible to achieve the result needed. Extra code is never welcome.
Tests/spec.ts files should be created with every new feature.
